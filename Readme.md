## 💡 **About the Project**  

This repository is structured to showcase two distinct approaches to crime classification:  

### **1️⃣ Classical Model**  
- A robust implementation using machine learning techniques like Logistic Regression, SVM, and Random Forest with fine-tuned hyperparameters.  
- **Deployment Link**: [Access the Classical Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PR-HARIHARAN/NLP_Classical).  

### **2️⃣ Deep Learning Model**  
- Harnessing the power of deep learning with models such as GRU, LSTM, and Bi-LSTM for high-accuracy multi-output classification.  
- **Deployment Link**: [Access the Deep Learning Model on Hugging Face](https://huggingface.co/spaces/PR-HARIHARAN/NLP_DEEP).
